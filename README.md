# secure-my-code

# Introduction

Usually I develop some small projects on the computer owned by the company.
I suspect IT possibly scan my computer in some secrety way. Also I don't trust *Github*/*GitLab*.

So the requirement is:
  - encrypted source code stored in Github.
  - encrypted source code stored in Disk.
  - encrypt/decrypt on the fly when editing the document.


# Implement

I write a small python script to achieve this goal, benefiting from the Python Script plugin of the Notepad++.
